##What is your site's primary purpose?##
To act as my homepage with contact information which currently will be used to post blog posts and projects I create for EDA. 
##Who is your target audience?##
For the next while my audience will be my Ruru cohort and the tutors at EDA.  
##How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?##
I want my website to be straightforward and simple as possible but also visually apealing and suprising. 
##How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?##
I will follow an F-shaped design, which will include a nav bar at the top, followed by a hero image with a title (my name) and contact details below and finally links to my blogs organized in two columns to devide between Tech and Cultural blogs.
